As a project team member, I want to ensure that every task related to the development of the
MyWebClass product is thoroughly tested, both through automation and manual testing, 
so that we can ensure the quality of the product and its effectiveness. By implementing this, 
we can achieve the project objective of minimizing or eliminating the amount of "push" in the 
MyWebClass.org project and measure its effectiveness quantitatively using Google Analytics,
while also passing the GDPR scanner. This will enable us to deliver a high-quality product that meets
the expectations of our users and stakeholders. By following established methodologies and principles,
we can quickly and effectively deliver project deliverables and set ourselves up for long-term success 
and growth
