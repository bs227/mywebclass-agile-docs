Title of the Epic: 

"Implement a User Feedback System"

Description:

This epic involves the implementation of a user feedback system to collect and analyze feedback 
from MyWebClass users. The system will include surveys, user testing, and tracking tools to gather
and analyze data on user behavior on the site.

Goals:

1. Improve the development process of MyWebClass by incorporating user feedback.
2. Increase user satisfaction and engagement with MyWebClass by addressing user needs and preferences.

User Stories:

1. As a product manager, I want to create a user feedback survey to gather information on user 
preferences and needs.
2. As a developer, I want to create a user testing plan to gather feedback on specific features 
or updates.
3. As a data analyst, I want to set up tracking tools to monitor user behavior on the site 
and identify areas for improvement.
4. As a product owner, I want to prioritize feedback and use it to inform the product roadmap.

Dependencies:

1. Availability of development resources: The development team will need to have the necessary
resources and expertise to develop and implement the "pull" process and automation tools.
2. User feedback mechanism: The development team will need to establish a mechanism for
users to provide feedback on the product, such as through surveys, feedback forms, or user 
testing sessions.
3. GDPR compliance: The development team will need to ensure that the product is GDPR compliant,
which may require legal and regulatory expertise.
4. User engagement and retention: The success of the MyWebClass product will depend on user 
engagement and retention, which may be impacted by the quality of the product, the user experience,
and the effectiveness of the "pull" process.
5. Technical infrastructure: The development team will need to ensure that the technical infrastructure, 
such as servers, hosting services, and databases, is sufficient to support the MyWebClass product
and handle user traffic.

Risks:

1. Users may not provide sufficient or accurate feedback, leading to incorrect conclusions 
and decisions. To mitigate this risk, the team will ensure that surveys and user testing plans are 
well-designed and targeted.

2. Implementing a user feedback system may require significant effort and resources. 
To mitigate this risk, the team will prioritize and phase the implementation.

Estimated Effort: 2-3 weeks.

Business Value: 

This epic will enable MyWebClass to better understand and address user needs and preferences, 
leading to higher user satisfaction and engagement. It will also improve the development process by incorporating user feedback, 
leading to more effective and efficient development.

Priority: High


user stories

1. Developing develop a "pull" process for the development of the MyWebClass product 
to minimize or eliminate the amount of "push" in the project
2. To measure user behavior on MyWebClass and gather insights to inform our development process.
