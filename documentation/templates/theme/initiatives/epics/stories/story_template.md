As a project manager for MyWebClass.org, I want to develop a "pull" process for the development
of the MyWebClass product, so that we can minimize or eliminate the amount of "push" in the 
project. This process should involve regular communication with stakeholders and users to obtain 
feedback and ensure that our development efforts are aligned with user needs.

Acceptance Criteria:

1.	Create consistent methods for engaging with users to facilitate communication.
2.	Design a mechanism for gathering user feedback and ranking feature suggestions based on importance.
3.	Confirm that development initiatives are in harmony with user requirements.
